## What is this?
This is the code archive for the initial labs and first project for the year 2025. The code is run on a custom-built variant of the MARS MIPS assembler and editor, where the 2025 installer is included in this repo. The code is written on VSC with a MIPS asm formatter. Do not code on the given MARS assembler/editor, as it is extremely inconveneint. Simply just write the code in VSC, and alt-tab over to MARS to assemble and run.

Project requirements/instructions may have changed, so make sure to cross-check.

## Two things of note: 
1. I have removed all comments on the submission file for obvious reasons. You may use a large language model to re-add comments or explain the code to you. Since this code is extrordinarily simple, LLMs are generally extremely accurate. In fact, all labs and the first project may be finished with LLM aid, as they are very simple.

2. The code is not the most optimized, especially for some labs where I don't use the built-in pseudoinstructions. You may want to optimize it yourself.
